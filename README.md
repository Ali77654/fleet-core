# Fleet Core

### Background

Fleet is a fictional ride sharing startup based in Silicon Valley. The company's goal is to provide a very convenient means of transportation for people across the nation. To ensure that the company stays competitive, Fleet has hired a "fleet" of talented engineers to build out their core system. You are fortunate to be one of those engineers and are ready to take on the tasks that lie ahead.

### Project Structure

The project contains 4 apis that are written in different languages but share the same file structure. Each api has a Location, Driver, Trip and Dispatch class.

```
Location => A point in the geographic coordinate system

Driver => A person driving passengers

Trip => A ride requested by a user

Dispatch => A unit that assigns a driver to a requested trip
```
